to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'poppler-cpp' found
Using PKG_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/poppler/cpp -I/usr/include/poppler

------------------------- ANTICONF ERROR ---------------------------
Configuration failed because poppler-cpp was not found. Try installing:
 * deb: libpoppler-cpp-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * rpm: poppler-cpp-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
 * csw: poppler_dev (Solaris)
 * brew: poppler (Mac OSX)
If poppler-cpp is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a poppler-cpp.pc file. If pkg-config
is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'
