*   checking PDF version of manual without hyperrefs or index ... ERROR
    ```
    Re-running with no redirection of stdout/stderr.
    Hmm ... looks like a package
    You may want to clean up by 'rm -Rf /tmp/RtmpOhc2l4/Rd2pdf8716654eab9'
    ```

*   checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING
    ```
    LaTeX errors when creating PDF version.
    This typically indicates Rd problems.
