[.tbl_df is careful about column indexes (#83)
==============================================

> foo <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = 1:10, z = 1:10)
> foo[0.5]
Error: Must subset columns with an index vector.
x Lossy cast from `j` <double> to <integer>.

> foo[1:5]
Error: Cannot subset columns 4, 5 in tibble with 3 columns.

> foo[-1:1]
Error: Must subset columns with an index vector.
i The subscript has a positive value at location 3.

> foo[c(-1, 1)]
Error: Must subset columns with an index vector.
i The subscript has a positive value at location 2.

> foo[-4]
Error: Cannot exclude column 4 in tibble with 3 columns.

> foo[c(1:3, NA)]
Error: Can't use NA as column index with `[` at position 4.

> foo[as.matrix(1)]
Error: `j` must be a logical vector.

> foo[array(1, dim = c(1, 1, 1))]
Error: Can't cast <integer[,1,1]> to <integer>.
Can not decrease dimensions


[.tbl_df is careful about column flags (#83)
============================================

> foo <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = 1:10, z = 1:10)
> foo[c(TRUE, TRUE)]
Error: Logical subscripts must match the size of the indexed input.
i The input has size 3.
x The subscript has size 2.

> foo[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
Error: Logical subscripts must match the size of the indexed input.
i The input has size 3.
x The subscript has size 4.

> foo[c(TRUE, TRUE, NA)]
Error: Can't use NA as column index with `[` at position 3.

> foo[as.matrix(TRUE)]
Error: `j` and `x` must have identical dimensions.

> foo[array(TRUE, dim = c(1, 1, 1))]
Error: `i` must have one dimension, not 3.


[[.tbl_df throws error with NA index
====================================

> foo <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
> foo[[NA]]
Error: Must extract with a single subscript.
x `j` can't be `NA`.
i This subscript can't be missing.

> foo[[NA_integer_]]
Error: Must extract with a single subscript.
x `j` can't be `NA`.
i This subscript can't be missing.

> foo[[NA_real_]]
Error: Must extract with a single subscript.
x `j` can't be `NA`.
i This subscript can't be missing.

> foo[[NA_character_]]
Error: Must extract with a single subscript.
x `j` can't be `NA`.
i This subscript can't be missing.


[<-.tbl_df throws an error with duplicate indexes (#658)
========================================================

> df <- tibble(x = 1:2, y = x)
> df[c(1, 1)] <- 3
Error: Column index 1 is used more than once for assignment.

> df[, c(1, 1)] <- 3
Error: Column index 1 is used more than once for assignment.

> df[c(1, 1), ] <- 3
Error: Row index 1 is used more than once for assignment.


$<- recycles only values of length one
======================================

> df <- tibble(x = 1:3)
> df$w <- 8:9
Error: Tibble columns must have consistent sizes, only values of size one are recycled:
* Size 3: Existing data
* Size 2: Column `w`

> df$a <- character()
Error: Tibble columns must have consistent sizes, only values of size one are recycled:
* Size 3: Existing data
* Size 0: Column `a`
